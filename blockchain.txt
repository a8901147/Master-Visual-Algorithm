how block chain work
miner
SHA256 need 4 zeros at the fronts

#Hash
unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data

#Hash Algorithm
A function that computes data into a unique hash

#Mining
The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem"
In out example, the "rpoblem: was to find a hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes get paid for mining blocks

#Decentralized
Having no single point of authority

#Block
A list of transactions mined together

#Nouce
A "Number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem.
It's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.

#Private key
only know to the key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions

#Private key -> Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm generate (hash) -> public key

#public key
Is derived from your private key. Anyone can "see" it, and us it to verify that a transaction came from you.

#signing a transaction
A "one way" process. someone with a private key signs a transactionbt their private key
being hashed with their transaction data.

Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key

#private key > public key > address

#consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain

#sybil resistance mechanism
1. proof od work -> mining 
    each blockchain decide its own algorithm, the block time could be long or short 
    depend on how hard the riddle is. For example: 0000 at the front

    proof of work is a piece of the overall consensus protocol, which in BItocin and Aetherium.
    one current case is Nakamoto consensus which is combination of proof of work, and the longest chain rule

    miners exhaust a lot of electricity to get the rewards-> here comes to the proof of stake
2. proof od stake
    instead of solving the difficult problem like proof of work, proof of stake nodes put up colloateral
    as a sybilresisteance mechanism

#sybil attack
user create whole bunch of pseudo anonymous accounts to try to influence the network

#51% attack

#longest chain rule

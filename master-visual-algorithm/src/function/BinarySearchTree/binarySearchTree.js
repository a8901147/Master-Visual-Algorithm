//balanced tree
//The absolute difference of heights of left and right subtrees at any node is less than 1

// Binary search tree
// Array Representation :
// The binary tree can be represented using an array of size 2n+1 if the depth of the binary tree is n.
// If the parent element is at the index p, Then the left child will be stored in the index 2p+1
// and the right child will be stored in the index (2p)+2.

//The array representation of the above binary tree is :
//As in the above binary tree, A was the root node, so it will be stored in the 0th index.
//The left child of A will be stored in the 2(0)+1 that is equal to the 1st location.
//So, B is stored in index 1. And, similarly, the right child of A will be stored in the 2(0)+2 index.
//For every node, the left and right child will be stored accordingly.
